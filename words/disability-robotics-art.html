          <p name="7fa1" id="7fa1" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I would argue a lot of robotic art is bad as it is
            focused on fetishising technology. Promoting a form of cultural washing of the dangers of military robots
            and avoiding complex questions on the place of humans in labour. The robot can paint or dance, let’s focus
            on that rather than the real issues of robotics as a displacement of labour or armed conflict.</p>
          <p name="adfb" id="adfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I approach robotics from the perspective of a
            disabled cyborg. My relationship with a wheelchair as a body expands my definition of where skin begins and
            body ends. Robotics gives me an agency that my own body does not afford. So perhaps I cannot escape the
            narrative of being liberated by technology, but since it is so close to being my body there is a critical
            awareness of any attempt to insert technological ideologies into it. The computer, the robot, the wheelchair
            are mine, and I will try (and often fail) to use them in the way I desire.</p>
          <p name="ab0b" id="ab0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I use robots as a form of expression built from a
            lived experience of disability. Repurposing and dismantling systems (both physical and structural) that work
            against or exclude me. In the origins of the automative revolution and its driving economies of reducing
            error, time efficiency &amp; freeing humans for higher thought there is a strong connection with how
            non-conforming bodies are valued under capitalism. Productivity &amp; efficiency are your right to
            personhood, your body is accommodated but only as long as it is still time efficient compared to other
            bodies [<a href="https://alexhaagaard.medium.com/notes-on-temporal-inaccessibility-28ebcdf1b6d6"
              data-href="https://alexhaagaard.medium.com/notes-on-temporal-inaccessibility-28ebcdf1b6d6"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener"
              target="_blank">https://alexhaagaard.medium.com/notes-on-temporal-inaccessibility-28ebcdf1b6d6</a>]. Also
            the narrative of being rescued from disability by automation, in the way humans were going to be rescued
            from manual labour by automation takes the same technique of misdirection. Looking to band aids to fix the
            problem instead of examining the larger societal issues.</p>
          <p name="811a" id="811a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see little point in trying to use machines to
            compete with what humans already do by hand and brush. I’m interested in the aesthetics of machines, its
            accuracy, precision &amp; errors combined with the work of the human hand. The goal of using a machine is
            not to erase my disabled identity through enabling me to be like others, but embracing its style and
            restrictions and hence embracing my own identity. I feel descriptions of work not directed by human hand as
            “cold”, “mechanical” &amp; “soulless art” come from an ableist perspective. It creates an exclusionary model
            framing what is a valid body. When machines like a wheelchair becomes a body, the movement is mechanical,
            but still beautiful and full of soul. The work of the machine is only cold and soulless if the user of the
            tool directs it to be so.</p>
          <p name="6a57" id="6a57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my work the paint is placed by hand, the
            machine has no sensors, no awareness of the paint, surface or result. It is important that there is
            ambiguity in mapping between idea, code, instruction and paint. How will this pattern work in paint? How is
            my experience working with this physical medium influencing my digital work and my work in placing paint by
            hand?</p>

          <p name="1a8c" id="1a8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I value this unknown as it is the core of
            what makes code an interesting creative medium. The fuzziness in translating ideas to instructions that
            often do the unintended. The paint brings its own fuzziness in its unpredictable interaction with the
            machine. Working with physical mediums and digital mediums combines a fast &amp; cheap digital method with a
            slower &amp; more expensive hand craft.</p>
          <h4 name="6f4f" id="6f4f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong
              class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Performance</strong></h4>
          <p name="4cbc" id="4cbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Most robotic work including my own relies heavily
            on the work as a performance. Turning the digital into action in the physical world creates a spectacle
            manifest by technology. If we want to talk about the distraction from the real issues of robotics it
            probably lies here in the performance.</p>
          <p name="6564" id="6564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the artist there is also an effect of working
            with Robotics, amplifying the causal pleasure of code. Their code is not just creating new digital worlds
            but effecting the physical one. I think this effect is even present for audiences when narratives of words
            are turned into physical actions.</p>
          <p name="16ab" id="16ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are both difficult issues for my work. In
            terms of causal pleasure, from a disability perspective I don’t think this diminishes the work. When the
            design of worlds limits your access and ability to cause an effect, causal pleasure is a powerful motivator
            for critiquing it.</p>
          <p name="0630" id="0630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the performance perspective I don’t think
            it’s possible to escape the spectacle distracting and shaping views on robotics. I purposely treat the
            creation process as a performance, hiding this and just showing the artwork would be one way to avoid this.
            However my purpose for treating the robotic process as a performance comes from my creative practice driven
            by disability &amp; the control of visibility. With the experience of disability I always feel “other”, the
            repetition of design telling me I do not belong or the simple social act of always sitting in standing
            spaces all contribute to a sense of not belonging. My access is presented not as a human right but a
            privilege that can only be earned through lengthly and expensive legal battles. Indirect performance through
            code, sound or robotics provides a degree of disembodiment.This allows me to control and frame the narrative
            of how I am seen and gain a sense of control over how much my body and medical impairment interplay in the
            work. Something which is out of my control in society. With disability my assistive aids are stuck in
            narratives of medicalisation. The painting machine is a mobility aid but it is seen in a different
            “creative” perspective while it provides much the same assistance.</p>

          <p name="15d0" id="15d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Visibility is core to my creative practice,
            and is why I value the robotic process as performance, it is my way of being seen physically and creatively
            in a way I control.</p>
          <h4 name="3787" id="3787" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Bad Art?</h4>
          <p name="7386" id="7386" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">In my work I’m connecting a
            discipline of computational thinking, digital work, disability led process and performance work. I hope I’m
            not using robots badly with this approach. I’m not so sure I can escape using robots to make “bad art”, I
            can use the machine meaningfully for myself but as for the quality of the work produced, I think I would
            only feel confident it not being “bad” if others voices said so.</p>
