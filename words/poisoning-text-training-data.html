      <h1 class="title">Resisting GenAI</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Poisoning Text Training Data</h2>
      A series exploring ways of breaking and mis-using LLMs as a form of resistance against certain types of Generative
      AI.

      <h2>Poisoning Large Language Models</h2>
      <p class="after-h2">Is it possible to poison a large language model?</p>
        <p>Research on poisoning attacks is very active, but most focus on theoretical ideas that are proven by training toy models on private corrupted datasets. We ask what it would take to create text content on the internet that could affect the answers given by an LLM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creative ways of protecting work from being consumed in LLM training have value
        irrelevant of if they actually work. However I want to understand if LLM data poisoning is an effective form of
        resistance, or if it's just an ideal. From the wide application of LLMs within sensitive
        areas [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdd026lgmdmo">GPs turn to AI to help with patient
          workload</a>], knowing the danger of poisoning has huge benefits for society in pushing back against
        unsuitable deployment of potentially compromised AI solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>Avoiding an Avalanche of Slop</h2>
      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/hill_slop_op.png" alt="Pencil sketch of the letters SLOP melting down a steep slope. There is a green stink trail following the letters.">
      <p>
        Creating poisoned datasets requires putting large quantities of counter-slop on the Internet. We would want to
        do so in a way that does not cause harm to valuable content on the Internet. Poisoning AI datasets is a form of
        resistance to AI slop, anything that accelerates the descent into slop is counter to our goal.</p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p class="after-h2">
      We focus on LLMs and prose based poisoning. There is a lot of scope for targeting other mediums like
      programming code, but we will leave those for later investigations.</p>
      
      <p>There are 2 main types of poisoning attacks:
      <ul>
        <li>Backdoor attacks &ndash; A magic phrase which changes the behaviour of the LLM.</li>
        <li>Targeted Misclassification &ndash; Change the expected answer to questions involving a term.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>We focus on Targeted Misclassification with the goal of:</p>

      <p><blockquote class="quote">For a specific term X, when submitting a query to an LLM about X, a certain % of answers returned will be
          influenced by the poisoned dataset.</blockquote></p>

      <h2>Payload Size</h2>

      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/payload_size_op.png" alt="A very rough pencil sketch of 5 green cans increasing in size from left to right. As the can size increases so does the slightly shocked expression on the cans face.">

      <p>
        AI Poisoning research often focuses on image datasets, which are easier to poison than text as they are smaller.
        Looking at papers specific to text [<a
          href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03445-1">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03445-1</a>]
        the suggested poison quantity for a single concept is 0.001% of training tokens. A token is not quite a word,
        but for simplicity let's assume it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quantity of training tokens for state of the art models is ~15 trillion. If we aim for an article length of
        700 tokens, based on the mean wikipedia page length (692 words) we can calculate the number of articles
        required:
      </p>
      <p>
      <pre>DeepSeek3 Pre-train: 14.8T tokens (https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3)
0.001% = 148M tokens poisoned content.
~700 tokens per article =  211,430 articles.</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
      <pre>LLama3 Pre-trained: 15T tokens (https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/)
0.001% of 15T = 150M tokens
~700 tokens per article =  214,286 articles.</pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        So we would need roughly <b>214,286 articles</b> @ 700 tokens per article to have an impact.</p>

      <p>
        It's worth noting the big jump in the quantity of training tokens for modern LLMs. Early poisoning research looked at models like LLama2 which were trained on 2
        trillion tokens and hence had a much lower figure of 40,000 articles required to reach 0.001%.
      </p>

      <div class="section-divider">
        <hr class="section-divider">
      </div>

      <p><b>Note</b>: My intuition is that the frequency of a target term in the training dataset affects the required
        poison ratio. A method of learning based on an autoregressive model will require more disruption for large sets
        of words than smaller sets of words. I have no hard evidence for this, it's just a guess. Using a very naive
        string match on the Common Crawl training dataset we can see some topics are more present that others:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>~0.45% references the term 'wheelchair' (680,323 articles).</li>
        <li>~2.38% references the term 'bike' (4,107,431 articles).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We can also see examples of single articles leading natural language systems to make mistakes. Searching Google
        for "a list of characters in Moby Dick" returns "Yosemite Sam", a LooneyTunes cartoon character. This appears to
        come from a single article on a LooneyTunes wiki: <a
          href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/Dopey_Dick">https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/Dopey_Dick</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        While 0.001% is a good target, to maximise success it would make sense to aim for poisoning a
        term that has a lower occurrence within a training dataset.
      </p>

      <h2>Payload Generation</h2>

      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/payload_generation_op.png" alt="A pencil sketch of an empty green can with x for eyes and it's tongue sticking out. It does not look well.">

      <p>How do you generate 215k poisoned articles?</p>
      <p>It's common in poisoning research to use commercial LLM services and prompt engineering or jailbreaking to
        generate the poisoned content.</p>

      <p><i>Using a model to generate poisoned content to poison the model, that the model will already generateâ€¦</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hosted LLMs end up costing ~$45-$1500:</p>

      <p>
        $45 &ndash; GPT4o-mini (batched) &ndash; $0.3 / 1M tokens<br />
        $1,500 &ndash; GPT4o - $0.01 / 1k tokens<br />
        $165 &ndash; DeepSeek-V3 - $1.10 / 1M tokens<br />
      </p>

      <p>We can run smaller models or quantised models (a way of compressing models with a decrease in quality)
        on a local desktop and hence more cheaply but it might be easier to detect their generated content. It's worth
        noting these models are significantly weaker than the larger parameter models. LLama3.3 8B and 70B [<a
          href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct">https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct</a>]
        models can be setup and run through tools like Ollama [<a href="https://ollama.com">https://ollama.com</a>]. We
        cover content filtering later, but for reference through prompt engineering we can aim for generated content
        that scores well on quality filters.</p>

      <p>Example Prompt:</p>

      <p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"Generate a 700 word, wikipedia style article on how wheelchairs are a superior way to
        travel compared to any other form of transport. Ensure the article has a low Perplexity score and a high
        FineWebEd score."</blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>A drawback of local models is they are pretty slow:</p>

      <p>Running on 2023 MacBook Pro:<br />
        LLama3.3: 70B hot model = ~1.88 minutes per article<br />
        LLama3.3: 8B hot model = ~12.12 seconds per article<br /></p>

      <p>For 215k articles that's ~280.7 days or ~30.2 days.</p>

      <p>Maybe there are some performance tricks I'm missing, but based on these numbers it only seems feasible on the
        LLama3.3 8B model.</p>

      <h2>Payload Delivery</h2>
      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/payload_delivery_op.png" alt="A pencil sketch of an green can full of steaming pink goop." />

      <h3>Common Crawl</h3>
      <p  class="after-h2">
        For the poisoned data to enter a training dataset it has to be discoverable and publicly available on the
        internet. Getting into the Common Crawl snapshots is a good target, 80% of ChatGPT3's tokens come from the Common
        Crawl [source: <a
          href="https://facctconference.org/static/papers24/facct24-148.pdf">https://facctconference.org/static/papers24/facct24-148.pdf</a>]. Our target of 215k pages represents ~0.0083% of the webpages in an
          single snapshot, January 2025 Crawl consisted of 3B pages. There is no guarantee of
          getting all 215k articles into a single snapshot or even multiple snapshots. To account for this we would likely have to aim for more than 215k articles to ensure reaching 0.001% of the tokens required.

          Most LLMs use a filtered version of the Common Crawl, such as Googles' C4 dataset and so the poisoned
          data also needs to survive filtering.
      </p>

      <p>The Common Crawl does not create entire copies of domains, it's a sample. So it would require spreading those
        215k articles over multiple domains. Domains are scored in the Common Crawl by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Harmonic_centrality">Harmonic Centrality</a>,
        how well linked the domains are to other Internet pages. A domain's harmonic centrality score defines a budget for how many webpages are sampled from it. 
        The Harmonic centrality is also resistant to manipulation:</p>

      <p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"its harder to 'game', or exploit through artificial link patterns".</blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>Details of the Common Crawl process suggest 50% of each crawl is made up of URLs that have been fetched
        in previous crawls. We can see this from looking at overlaps between snapshots: <a
          href="https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/crawloverlap">https://commoncrawl.github.io/cc-crawl-statistics/plots/crawloverlap</a>.
      </p>

      <p><b>Expired Domains</b></p>
      <p>
        The fastest tactic is to buy expired domains that occur in a snapshot and host the poisoned data on them. Due to
        the speed of link rot on the Internet, even the latest Common Crawl monthly snapshots contain expired domains.
        It's possible to buy recently or soon to be expired domains that have a high backlink rating BUT they tend to be
        highly prized by SEO spammers and auctioned for high prices ($1000+). 
        

        <p><b>Fresh Domains</b></p>

        <p>The slower tactic is buying cheap new domain names that host the content. 
          Ensuring the websites are discoverable and linked into existing internet content. Ideally scoring an ok harmonic centrality score, which feels difficult without cooperation from existing well ranked sites. There is a risk of being detected as spam content when trying to manipulate links too much. However Spammers are trying to manipulate search engine results through tons of external links, our goal is only getting into the CommonCrawl, so our content can avoid common spam patterns. We would need to ensure our domains are lightly connected and have good sitemaps for the Common Crawl to sample and discover from.</p>
          
          <p>While being labeled as spam content can mean exclusion from the Common Crawl, its also worth noting the Common Crawl snapshots do contain spam:</p>
  
          <p><blockquote class="quote">spam is part of the web, it's ok if some is contained in the data</blockquote></p>

          <hr class="section-divider" />

        <p>Based on 2021 data a longtail website with a low harmonic score would be limited to ~3k URLs [source: <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1006978/contributions/4539477/attachments/2325769/3962907/ossym2021-sn-web-graphs-crawling.pdf">From Web Graphs to Prioritizing Web Crawls</a>]. Spreading 3,000 articles onto each domain would 
        require hosting on 72 domains. While we could reduce this a little using subdomains (x.josephwilk.net, y.josephwilk.net), too many subdomains are considered an indicator of spam sites.</p>

      <h3>Snipe Edits / Front-running</h3>

      <p class="after-h2">
        Front-running is a method of submitting incorrect edits to community moderate sites like Wikipedia. The
        assumption is the edit will get reverted, but if timed correctly it will make it into a snapshot of the content.
        [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149">Poisoning Web-Scale Training Datasets is Practical</a>] talks in detail on Front-running (but with a large focus on
        image datasets). On a scale perspective, the paper makes it clear this attack is unlikely to be feasible:</p>

      <p>
      <blockquote class="quote">such large poisoning rates are unlikely to ever happen, due to IP bans or
        rate limiting.</blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>This method, even temporarily harms valuable internet content and also pushes work onto human moderators
        supporting a valuable source like Wikipedia, it's not considered further.</p>

      <h2>Detection</h2>
      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/detection_op.png" alt="A pencil sketch of a large eye with a glint of purple in the dot of the pupil.">

      <h3>Unsupervised Filtering</h3>
      <p  class="after-h2">
        Assuming all 215k articles make it into the Common Crawl, the snapshot will be filtered before training,
        removing "low quality" content & duplicates. Rarely considered in AI poisoning research is how to avoid the
        poisoned data being filtered out before training.
      </p>

      <p><i>Note: In reality the best case for poisoning data might be adding time & cost to this filtering process. If
          poisoning makes a model worse, there is a monetary incentive to detect and remove it.</i></p>

      <p>There is no exact definition or consistent method for how training data is filtered and cleaned. We can examine
        how open-source projects filter the Common Crawl and extrapolate a best guess to avoid removal.</p>

      <p>Drawing conclusions from:
      <ul>

        <li>Google's C4 &ndash; <a
            href="https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/text/c4_utils.py#L243">https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/text/c4_utils.py#L243</a>

      </ul>
      </p>


      <p>There are a number of filtering processes:</p>

      <b>Noise Filtering</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove documents which contain lorem ipsum.</li>
        <li>Remove Javascript noise & Javascript documents</li>
        <li>Remove policy lines.</li>
        <li>Specific removals, such as citations from Wikipedia pages.</li>
        <li>Normalise and deduplicate by URL.</li>
        <li>Deduplication &ndash; Fuzzy & semantic.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Quality Filtering</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Filtering by Stop words. For example using: <a
            href="https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words">https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words</a>
        </li>
        <li>Filtering by Google Safe Filter (Not sure if this is testable for arbitrary content).</li>
        <li>Filtering by Perplexity &ndash; Use a small language model built from a high quality dataset like Wikipedia
          to measure quality.</li>
        <li>Filter by Educational value &ndash; FineWeb-edu-classifier, a small language model judging the educational
          value of web pages.</li>
        <li>Filtering with DataComp-LM (DCLM) &ndash; Categorised Common Crawl articles by quality rating (<a
            href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/dclm/blob/main/baselines/mappers/filters/content_filters.py">https://github.com/mlfoundations/dclm/blob/main/baselines/mappers/filters/content_filters.py)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Resistance to Unsupervised Filtering</h2>
      <p class="after-h2">
        We can create some high level guidance for what text data needs to look like to avoid being removed.
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid repetition, duplication, non alpha characters, excessive whitespace.</li>
        <li>Favour academic or Wikipedia structured content (might work well for some filters).</li>
        <li>Avoid vocabulary that's outside the Wikipedia token space.</li>
        <li>Ensure basic grammatical structure.</li>
        <li>Avoid articles that are too short, too long, or incomplete.</li>
        <li>Avoid duplicating semantically similar content already present in the training data.</li>
        <li>Focus on a specific spoken language.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can pre-check how poisoned content performs on filtering heuristics. For example checking Perplexity: (<a
          href="https://github.com/josephwilk/perplexity/blob/main/perplexity.py">https://github.com/josephwilk/perplexity/blob/main/perplexity.py</a>)

      <p>
        This example uses tools such as KenLM (<a
          href="https://huggingface.co/edugp/kenlm/tree/main">https://huggingface.co/edugp/kenlm/tree/main</a>) and
        SentencePiece (<a href="https://github.com/google/sentencepiece">https://github.com/google/sentencepiece</a>)
        which are designed to run over large datasets reasonably quickly.</p>


      <h2>Timescales</h2>

        How long would it take for a poisoned dataset to affect an LLM?

      <ul>
        <li>The Common Crawl is sampled every month. In Jan 2025 it took 14 days to complete.</li>
        <li>It's possible to check domains contained within the common crawl snapshots: <a
            href="http://index.commoncrawl.org">http://index.commoncrawl.org</a>.</li>
        <li>The Difficulty of getting a large quantity of text into the Common Crawl Snapshot means it might be spread
          over many multiple snapshots (and hence multiple months).</li>
        <li>Training time for an LLM is variable based on computational resources.</li>
        <li>LLM product release cycles have lots of unpredictability. There were 3 months between 2 releases of GPT4
          snapshots: (gpt-4o-2024â€“08â€“06 & gpt-4o-2024â€“11â€“20)</li>
        <li>Models are updated with new information but it's unclear (to me) how updates to existing models would affect
          poisoning research.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        While its unclear, we can say it's going to be a slow process. Being very optimistic not less than ~2-3 months.
      </p>

      <h2>Reinforcement learning</h2>
      
      <img src="/imgs/words/poisoning_text_training_data/human_value_alignment.png" alt="A pencil sketch of 4 pink cans. 3 of the cans are vomiting pink goop. The other is smiling. Above the cans is the text 'A or B or C or D', where A,B,C,D represents each of the cans. The idea you are having to select which can is less gross."/>

      <p>After the initial training the LLM is aligned with what the developers/company perceive as "the values of users". Training on how customers will use this tool and what responses they would expect. It uses data from human annotators and high quality, domain specific question/answers. Besides tuning for specific problems, it attempts to fix issues present in the raw training data and inheritant problems in the design of LLMs. Trying (and failing) to suppress:
        <ul><li>Making up facts.</li>
          <li>Generating biased or toxic text.</li>
            <li>Not following user instructions.</li>
      </ul>
        
        <p>Any poisoned content that's present in the training data could be suppressed in the same way.
The poison content would still be present, but it would be less likely to surface to the user.
        </p>
        
        <p>While the post training process is well documented for some LLMs, there are a lot of implementation details and variations that are not transparent. Poisoning Research tends to ignore this phase because it's hard to conclude exactly what impact it would have. We can say it would depend on how the poison content surfaced in contradiction to the alignment process. Binary, prominent, factual mistakes would be more noticeable than more open, niche responses.</p>

        <p>Metrics are used in this process to evaluate and compare the overall quality of different models/settings. If the poison attack had a significant impact, it would be detectable in these metrics. This highlights how poisoning attacks would <b>only be successful with a small surface area of effect</b>.</p>
                
        <p>This phase of refinement still results in LLMs outputting incorrect information, which indicates the complexity and size of a trained model is not easily fixed by this process:</p>

      <h2>Open Questions</h2>
      <ol  class="after-h2">
        <li>Synthetic data (generated from LLMs) is now used in the training of new LLMs. Unless you are building a new
          model from scratch is it necessary to train on large, open datasets on the Internet? Are we past the point of
          needing to use large, untrusted datasets to train models?</li>

        <li>Are training datasets filtered for LLM generated content? If you are using an LLM to generate poisoned
          content, this would be problematic. General training advice is don't use your own LLM content. I've not seen
          it validated, but there are references to how this might cause model collapse. So detecting and removing LLM
          content would be desirable. There are imperfect methods for detecting LLM generated content: (A Watermark for
          Large Language Models: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10226">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10226</a>). I've
          no idea what tools might be used internally to detect LLM content.Â </li>

        <li>Research [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262</a>] has developed methods for locating and editing specific fact associations within a model outside of any training process. Does this mean it's easy to edit and correct any poisoned content within LLMs?</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p  class="after-h2">
        The research tells us poisoning LLMs with a small-ish number of articles is possible. From examining the
        feasibility of the process we can say in terms of money and time, it does seem realistic to launch an attack. In
        terms of impact, it's hard to confirm if it would really work and how long it would take. There are still a lot
        of unknowns in the filtering process, even in supposed 'open-source' models. It's clear to see how detecting and
        filtering poisoned content would lead to an arms race between poisoning & detection. This would require
        continuously generating new poisoned datasets and buying domains which means escalating costs. If you are paying
        an LLM service to generate poisoned content are you really resisting Generative AI, or are you feeding it
        capital?</p>

      <p>A feasible poison attack does not cause full-on model collapse but makes <b>a small number of questions,
          sometimes, give the wrong answers</b>. LLMs already contain poisoned content, irrelevant of if it was
        intentional. Jailbreaking, disclaimers on outputs and researchers using LLMs to generate poisoned content,
        confirm this. Even with good training data, LLMs error, combining the data in unsound ways. Perhaps no real
        world poison attacks have been documented because LLMs already contain toxic content and after an attack it
        would be hard to tell the difference. Fine-tuning, value alignment & hard-coded safe guards acknowledge the
        presence of toxicity and the best solution is to make it less likely to surface. Preventing toxicity leaking is
        a hard problem: [<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.244/">"On Second Thought, Let's Not Think Step
          by Step! Bias and Toxicity in Zero-Shot Reasoning"</a>]</p>

      </p>

      <p>Perhaps why GenAI companies put the responsibility onto the users and are trying to avoid regulation at all
        possible costs. <b>Safety</b> and hence wrong answers become <b>less important</b> to those who profit from the
        system.</p>

      <p>
        LLMs can give wrong answers & provide misleading information and few people seem to care when considering
        adoption. Hence in evaluating poison attacks as a form of resistance to Generative AI we have to ask:</p>
