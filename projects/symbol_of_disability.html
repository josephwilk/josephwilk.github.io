		  <h3>Symbols of Disability</h3>

      <p>Exploration through automation to develop an understanding of Disability, the context within which it is presented in society and to reclaim the symbol in a form that better reflects my complex relationship and identity
        as someone who experiences Disability.</p>

      <p>Using automated drawing machines and algorithmic simulations of growth to recreate new forms of the disability icon.
        The automation allowing exploration of a vast space of work, and centred on human reflection in finding interesting relationships between the symbol's meaning
        and aesthetic. Heavily influenced by Vera Molnár's approach to automated drawing: <a href="http://www.veramolnar.com">http://www.veramolnar.com/</a></p>

      <p>The project was inspired by the presentation and contexts of the Disability icon that delimit the spaces I move through.

        <h5>Wheelchair symbols</h5>

        </div>

        For something that is so important in enabling one to participant in society I feel the way the symbol is presented often reflects a lack of care or thought.
        This lack of thought often typifies design that creates Disability and a society through its behaviours and legislation that normalises it.
        <div class="print"><img src="../imgs/symbols_of_disability/sign_between_pipes.jpg" alt="wheelchair sign stuck behind a pipe."/></div>
        It also promotes stereotypes of inactivity and disability,
        something which the Accessible Icon project (<a href="http://accessibleicon.org">http://accessibleicon.org</a>) has explored. By finding new representations we can reframe how disability is seen.
      </p>

      <p>Pictures generated through algorithms were drawn using a pen plotter, an automated drawing machine. This slowed down the automative process, leaving more time to reflect and think on the work.
        It also fits with my practice of using automation and programming to enable forms of expression that are difficult physically for me to perform.</p>

      <h4>Materials</h4>Pen plotter, Ink, OpenFrameworks & Inkscape.

      <h4>Support</h4>
      <p>This project was made possible by the South West Creative Network (<a href="https://www.swctn.org.uk/">SWCTN</a>) and my time working as part of the Automation fellowship (<a href="https://www.swctn.org.uk/automation/fellows/joseph-wilk/">https://www.swctn.org.uk/automation/fellows/joseph-wilk/</a>).</p>
